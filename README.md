# Food-Image-Recognition-and-Calorie-Estimation

This project is an introductory project to understand computer vision and object detection. 

In this project, a model based on Faster RCNN is trained to recognise multiple fruits on a dataset of 300 images. 
The dataset has images of apples, bananas and oranges and some images which are combinations of the three.

It predicts the fruits in a given image and predficts the total calories in the fruits.
